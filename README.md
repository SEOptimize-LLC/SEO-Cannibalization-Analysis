# SEO Cannibalization Analysis Tool

## Overview
This enhanced version of the SEO Cannibalization Analysis Tool provides URL-level consolidation recommendations with advanced metrics including keyword overlap analysis, semantic similarity scoring, and comprehensive traffic impact calculations.

## New Features

#### Recommendation Types:
1. **Merge & Redirect**: High overlap and similarity - implement 301 redirect
2. **Redirect Secondary**: Good overlap - redirect after content audit
3. **Evaluate Content Merge**: Moderate overlap - review before deciding
4. **Monitor & Optimize**: Low overlap - keep separate and optimize individually

```

## Installation & Setup

### Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Plotly

### Running the Tool

- Filter thresholds in the UI

## Benefits Over Original Version

| Feature | Original | Enhanced |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Analysis Level | Query-level | URL-level |
| Overlap Metrics | Basic | Comprehensive |
| Traffic Impact | Query-based | URL-based |
| Recommendations | Simple merge/redirect | 4-tier system |
| Filtering | Basic | Advanced |
| Export Options | Single format | Multiple formats |
| Confidence Scoring | None | Weighted scoring |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **No URL recommendations**: Check minimum overlap and recovery thresholds
2. **Large datasets**: Processing may take longer - consider filtering by date range
3. **Memory issues**: Reduce dataset size or increase system memory

### Performance Tips:
- Filter by date range before export from GSC
- Use brand filtering to reduce dataset size
- Adjust minimum thresholds to focus on high-impact opportunities
